# South_Amercian_Indicators
With this shiny app you can compare some indicators from South American countries. It is possible to compare homicide rate and life expectancy, GDP per capita and HDI, among other comparisons. The app is able to compare up to three dimensions: x-axis, y-axis, color of plotted data, and it's still possible to segment the graph in facets.
